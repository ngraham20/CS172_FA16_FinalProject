You are standing in the middle of a beautiful garden.
A huge oak tree towers high above you, casting shade
upon the northern fence. Scattered throughout the grass
are hundreds of beautiful flowers, glowing brightly
in the sunlight. The garden leads both east and west, and
a glass door to the south leads into the house.
