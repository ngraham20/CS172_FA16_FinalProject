Standing in the courtyard, you can see a fountain bubbling up in the
center, water pooling in a circle around it. Looking up, you can see
a balcony overlooking the courtyard from the second story of a room
to the east. A glass door in this room reveals a glinting black grand
piano inside. The ground in the courtyard is cobblestone, and a pathway 
of cobblestone leads north through a flower arch. To the west is a white
door, and to the south, a glass door, revealing a small room with bird
cages.
