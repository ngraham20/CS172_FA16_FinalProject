Upon entering the greenhouse, you imediately notice how much harder
it is to breathe. Filling the air, is damp mist coming from hoses lining
the celing. The floor is made of brick, and leads between several rows of
plants. On the back wall is a shelving unit filled with closed cupboards.
On the western wall of the greenhouse is the door.
