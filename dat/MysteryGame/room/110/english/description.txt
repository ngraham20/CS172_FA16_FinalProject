You are standing in a large kitchen, where the staff would prepare the meals.
A thick, wooden island stands in the middle of the room with knive holders in
the center of it. Various pots and pans hang from the celing just above it as
well. Around the edges of the room sit the stove and conventional oven, and in
the north wall is even an old-style fire oven. In the corner, leading downwards,
is a thin staircase. Looking down it, you can't see through the blackness. In the
south wall stands an old wooden door, and in the eastern wall, stand two salloon-
style swinging doors.
