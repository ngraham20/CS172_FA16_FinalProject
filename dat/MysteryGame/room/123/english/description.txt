You are standing in the middle of a square white room with a skylight.
You hear the many chirps of dozens of birds in cages, all hanging from the
celing within arms reach. You haven't seen a caretaker, but all the birds
seem to be healthy. To the north is a glass door leading out into the courtyard,
and to the south is a simple wooden door. To the west is a door which seems to
be fancier than the others.
