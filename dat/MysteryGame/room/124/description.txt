You are standing in the center of a great armory. Lining every wall
is a myriad of war paintings depicting the great feats of famous generals
throughout history. Against the western wall stands a towering glass case.
Inside this case is hung an ancient samurai uniform, and near the eastern
wall stands a wooden sword-stand. In the south wall stands a wooden door,
and in the northern wall stands a thick oaken door with a glass handle.
