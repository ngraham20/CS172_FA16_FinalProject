You are standing at the south end of a long hallway. A small window in
the south wall shows the front yard, one floor below, but besides that 
and a simple wallpaper pattern lining the bottom half of the walls, you 
can't see anything interesting. The hallway continues north, and simple 
doors lead both east and west.
