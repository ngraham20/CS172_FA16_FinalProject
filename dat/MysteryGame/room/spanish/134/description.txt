You stand in the middle of an enormous library. The smell of old books
penetrates your nostrils, and the sense of knowledge and adventure
radiates from the room. Looking up, you see a balcony surrounding 
the room, leaving a square-shaped gap through which you can see a
second floor of bookshelves. On one of the many pillars supporting
the balcony, hangs a tall ladder by which you can climb to the
second floor. To the north, lies a dark, wooden door. To the 
east lies a stairwell, leading downwards, and to the west, lies two 
oaken doors.
