You stand in the eastern part of the garden. Covering the ground
are dozens of beautiful flowers, and a cobblestone pathway leads through
a flower-arch to the south. Looking east, you can see a greenhouse, where
hundreds of various plants seem to be growing. The garden streatches further
to the west.
