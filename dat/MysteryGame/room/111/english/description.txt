You are standing at the end of a long hallway, lined with paintings.
Running along the center if the hallway is a grand dining table with
candles, plates, silverware, and other kitchen items placed neatly
on it. In the north wall lies a window. Looking through it, you can
see a garden with a fishing pond. The hallway streatches further
south, and a wide arch leads east into a sky-lit room. In the west
wall hangs a set of saloon-style swinging doors.
