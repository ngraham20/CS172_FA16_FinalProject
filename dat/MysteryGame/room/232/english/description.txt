You are standing on the upper landing of a great hallway, looking down upon
a grand wooden floor, with a family crest of some kind. Paintings of various
kinds line the walls, and two grand staircases on either side of the landing
lead down to the main floor. Leading east and west from the landing are simple,
white doors, and a pair of double doors lead north.
