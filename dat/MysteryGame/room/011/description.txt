You find yourself standing in the middle of the large cellar. One 
large support stands in front of you. On its southern side rests a 
wooden table with plain white runner. On the table is a bottle of 
wine and several books. To the north there is a small, green wooden 
door, and to the south a large steel door. There is a plain wooden 
door to the east and advancing west takes you back to the landing.
