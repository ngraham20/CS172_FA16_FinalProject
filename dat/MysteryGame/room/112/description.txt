You stand in the middle of a grand room lined with marble.
Above your head, edging the walls, is a balcony. Above that,
a wonderous glass dome glints brightly in the sunlight.
In the north wall lies a sliding glass door leading outside,
a wooden door lies in the west wall, a white door lies in
the eastern wall, and a grand archway leads south.
