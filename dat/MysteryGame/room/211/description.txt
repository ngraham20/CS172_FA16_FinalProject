You are standing in a small bedroom. There is a bed on the east 
wall of the room and a small white bedside table stands next to 
it. On the table is a vase of fresh flowers and a letter. The dresser 
on the western wall is lined with photographs of a family. There 
are framed watercolor paintings on the walls. A door on the north 
wall leads to a balcony.
