You are standing on the second floor of an enormous library. Shelves of old
books spread in every direction from the square interrior balcony, which 
overlooks the lower floor from all sides. Hanging from the inner edge of the
balcony is a ladder, by which you could decend to the lower floor. Old, wooden
doors lead north, east, and west.
