You are in a long hallway with a deep red carpet streatching
the length of it. Lining the walls are tall, shining suits of
armor, each one with lance in hand. Between them, on the walls,
hang various paintings of bright colors. Tall, grand arches lead
both north and south, and a fancy-looking door lies in the west wall.
